# Thor

An event-driven AI team member that watches Slack and scheduled jobs, resumes OpenCode sessions through the runner, and reaches external systems through `remote-cli`.

## Architecture

```text
ingress -> gateway -> runner -> opencode
                           \
                            -> remote-cli -> MCP upstreams / CLI integrations
```

- `gateway` accepts Slack, GitHub webhook, and cron events, batches them, and forwards them to the runner.
- `runner` manages OpenCode session continuity and streams progress back out.
- `remote-cli` exposes `POST /exec/*` endpoints for git, gh, sandbox, scoutqa, langfuse, metabase, MCP tool calls, and approval status/resolution.

## Services

| Service       | Port | Package            | Role                                        |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `cron`        | -    | `docker/cron`      | Scheduled prompts                           |
| `mitmproxy`   | 3080 | `docker/mitmproxy` | Explicit outbound HTTP(S) proxy             |
| `gateway`     | 3002 | `@thor/gateway`    | Slack/GitHub webhook ingestion and batching |
| `remote-cli`  | 3004 | `@thor/remote-cli` | CLI + MCP policy gateway                    |
| `grafana-mcp` | 8000 | Docker image       | Grafana MCP server                          |
| `ingress`     | 8080 | `docker/ingress`   | Reverse proxy + Vouch integration           |
| `opencode`    | 4096 | Docker image       | Headless agent runtime                      |
| `runner`      | 3000 | `@thor/runner`     | Session lifecycle + NDJSON progress stream  |
| `vouch`       | 9090 | Docker image       | OAuth/SSO proxy                             |

## Quick Start

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required secrets.
2. Initialize the mitmproxy CA on the host:

```bash
./scripts/mitmproxy-ca-init.sh
```

This keeps the private key on the host and only exposes the public trust bundle
inside `opencode`.

3. Start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

4. Clone repos into the shared workspace from the `remote-cli` container:

```bash
docker compose exec remote-cli \
  git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git /workspace/repos/your-repo
```

5. Configure `/workspace/config.json` with repo-to-upstream access rules.

Example:

```json
{
  "repos": {
    "your-repo": {
      "channels": ["C12345678"],
      "proxies": ["atlassian", "grafana"]
    }
  }
}
```

The shared upstream registry and allow/approve policy are checked into
[`packages/common/src/proxies.ts`](packages/common/src/proxies.ts).

## Outbound HTTP(S) proxy path

Thor's outbound HTTP(S) routing for operator-invoked clients is explicit:

```text
opencode -> HTTP(S)_PROXY -> mitmproxy -> upstream
```

- `opencode` sets both lowercase and uppercase proxy env vars (`http_proxy`,
  `https_proxy`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, with matching `NO_PROXY` forms).
- Supported outbound clients in this workflow are `curl` and built-in `fetch()`.
- This is env-proxy routing, not transparent interception or firewall-style
  egress enforcement.
- OpenAI and ChatGPT domains are passthrough by default (no injected
  credentials).

Custom credential rules and passthrough hosts live in
`/workspace/config.json` under `mitmproxy[]` and `mitmproxy_passthrough[]`.
Keep secrets in `.env` only, then reference them in config via `${ENV_VAR}`.
Rules can match either an exact `host` or a `host_suffix`, and can optionally
add `path_prefix` when one domain needs different headers by URL prefix.

Built-in defaults are intentionally narrow:

- Atlassian: injected auth for `api.atlassian.com` and `*.atlassian.net`,
  both read-only by default
- Atlassian media redirects: `api.media.atlassian.com` passthrough
- Slack API: injected auth only for `chat.postMessage`, thread/history reads,
  `files.info`, and the upload setup/complete endpoints on `slack.com/api/...`
- Slack files: read-only downloads on `files.slack.com/files-pri/...` and
  upload flow support on `files.slack.com/upload/v1/...`
- OpenAI and ChatGPT domains: passthrough only

## Deployment Configuration

Use [`docs/github-app-webhooks.md`](docs/github-app-webhooks.md) for GitHub App webhook setup, required permissions/subscriptions, and troubleshooting.

Gateway and remote-cli derive the GitHub App bot commit identity from `GITHUB_APP_SLUG` and `GITHUB_APP_BOT_ID`: `${GITHUB_APP_BOT_ID}+${GITHUB_APP_SLUG}[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`. Gateway uses that derived email to accept `check_suite.completed` CI wakes only for Thor-authored commits; no separate author-email env var is required.

Thor uses a shared workspace config file at `/workspace/config.json` inside the containers. On the host, that file lives at `docker-volumes/workspace/config.json`. Use [`docs/examples/workspace-config.example.json`](docs/examples/workspace-config.example.json) as the starting point, and use [`packages/common/src/proxies.ts`](packages/common/src/proxies.ts) as the reference for the built-in upstream catalog.

GitHub App installation entries live under `owners.<owner>.github_app_installation_id` in that config:

```json
{
  "owners": {
    "acme": {
      "github_app_installation_id": 12345678
    }
  }
}
```

The `git` wrapper resolves installation tokens lazily through `GIT_ASKPASS`, and the `gh` wrapper resolves them before invoking `gh`. `remote-cli` now requires GitHub App env vars at startup; `GITHUB_PAT` is only an optional fallback for command execution after the service is up.

If you have internal APIs that Thor should access with injected credentials,
define rules in `/workspace/config.json` and keep only secret values in `.env`:

```json
{
  "mitmproxy": [
    {
      "host": "billing.example.com",
      "path_prefix": "/v1/",
      "headers": { "X-Custom-Auth": "${BILLING_API_KEY}" }
    },
    {
      "host_suffix": ".internal.example",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${INTERNAL_API_TOKEN}" },
      "readonly": true
    }
  ],
  "mitmproxy_passthrough": ["api.openai.com", ".anthropic.com"]
}
```

mitmproxy evaluates user rules first, then built-in defaults. OpenAI and
ChatGPT domains are already allowed as passthrough by default.
Rules match by exact host or suffix first, then by optional `path_prefix`.

## Operations Notes

- Tell Thor about your team, repos, and channel conventions in the OpenCode UI after the stack is up. That context is stored in persistent memory.
- Clone source repos from the `remote-cli` container so git credentials and filesystem ownership stay consistent.
- Repos under `/workspace/repos` are mounted read-only into OpenCode. Thor creates edits in `/workspace/worktrees`.
- Scheduled prompts live in `docker-volumes/workspace/cron/crontab`.

## Security Model

- OpenCode does not get direct API credentials for MCP upstreams.
- `remote-cli` enforces MCP allow/approve policy server-side and stores approvals under `/workspace/data/approvals`.
- Gateway↔remote-cli internal routes are secret-gated with `x-thor-internal-secret`, including `POST /exec/mcp` approval resolution and `POST /internal/exec`.
- `git` uses GitHub App installation tokens through `GIT_ASKPASS` when `owners.<owner>.github_app_installation_id` is configured and the target owner can be resolved; `GITHUB_PAT` is only a fallback during command execution.
- `gh` resolves GitHub App auth before execution and can fall back to inherited `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_PAT` when no installation token is available, but the service itself still requires GitHub App env at startup.
- Source repos are mounted read-only into OpenCode; edits happen in `/workspace/worktrees`.
- Tool calls are audit-logged under `/workspace/worklog`.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm test:mcp
pnpm test:e2e          # deterministic direct checks only; never calls /trigger
pnpm test:opencode-e2e # separate explicit OpenCode/LLM smoke path
pnpm typecheck
```
